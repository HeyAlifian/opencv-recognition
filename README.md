# opencv-recognition-python
A hand, emotion recognition and object detection using mediapipe, deepface, and opencv Python. Trained models are also included inside the 'models' folder, this is for educational purposes only. **Note: this project uses live camera capture, you can also capture just from a photo.**
### Installation:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Read Photo Only
I have prepared the file for read photo only, which is called 'cv2-image.py' and you can also change the image file path to your own image. Make sure that you have your image inside the correct path/folder, it will affect how the code executes.
```python
image_path = 'images/image.jpg'  # Replace with your image path
```

### Live Camera Capture
Run the 'cv2-cameracapture.py' file, and you're good to go.
